- 👋 Hi, I’m @SuzGupta.
- 👀 I’m interested in Swift, SwiftUI and developing for Apple platforms generally. It's possible I've been an Apple fangirl since before you were born.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of open-source collaboration as well as building some personal apps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting, meaningful Swift project. I'm especially jazzed about food, environment and education-related projects.
- 📫 You can find me on Twitter [@SuzGupta](https://twitter.com/SuzGupta). I'm also baking away on Instagram, if that's your jam.
